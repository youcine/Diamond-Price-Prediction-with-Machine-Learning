# Diamond-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Kaggle competition to predict diamond prices using advanced machine learning techniques.


Project Name:
Diamond Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Description:
This project is part of the SHAI For AI | شاي للذكاء الاصطناعي Machine Learning Engineering internship, where we participated in a Kaggle competition to predict diamond prices using advanced machine learning techniques. Our goal was to develop a robust predictive model based on a rich dataset of diamond attributes, including carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and more. We conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation to identify the most effective algorithms and achieve high prediction accuracy. The final model was fine-tuned using Random Forest and other regression techniques, resulting in impressive performance metrics.

Key Highlights:
Dataset: Comprehensive data on diamond properties such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (X, Y, Z).
Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for accuracy assessment.
Methods: Utilized Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest models, with hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV.
Results: Achieved high prediction accuracy with significant improvements over traditional methods.
Future Work: Focus on better outlier handling, advanced feature engineering, and exploring sophisticated models.

Repository Contents:
Data: Preprocessed and cleaned datasets used for training and testing.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing code for EDA, model training, and evaluation.
Models: Implementations of various regression models and their performance analysis.
Results: Detailed reports on model performance and insights derived from the analysis.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Follow the instructions in the notebooks to replicate the analysis and model training.
Use the trained model to predict diamond prices for new data.
